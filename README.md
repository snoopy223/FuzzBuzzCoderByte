# AngularTemplate
Angular app basic template with ng-click example for factory to controller connection

This is a VERY basic and barebones Angular template used to quickly standup Angular webapps for a variety of reasons. 
For learning purposes a fully function ng-click has been left in the app to demonstrate the Angular cycle of operation.
